# Ignition

The ignition package is used to generate the necessary boilerplate for a Sitegear website.

This is a "turn-key" solution for creating a website using Sitegear (pun intended).

## Distribution

In general the "master" script at http://sitegear.org/ignition/resources/ignition.php should be used.

This repository is available for those wishing to browse the code.

## Usage

To create a skeleton website with the necessary boilerplate to start working in Sitegear, follow these simple steps:

 1. Start in an empty directory where your website will be created:

    mkdir mywebsite.com
    cd mywebsite.com

 2. Download and execute the ignition script in one command:

    wget -q -O - http://sitegear.org/ignition/resources/ignition.php | php

 3. Answer the questions when prompted.

 4. Watch as the relevant magic is applied and you will have a site skeleton ready to built on.
